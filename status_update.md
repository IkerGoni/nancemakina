# Project Status Update - May 12 2025 18:02

**Current Phase:** Pre-Testnet Validation - Codebase Cleanup and Packaging

**Overall Progress:**
- All core modules for the Binance Futures Trading Bot MVP (V1 Strategy) have been developed.
- Initial unit tests have been created for most modules.
- Documentation structure is in place (README, Configuration Guide, Architecture, Troubleshooting).
- The codebase has undergone several rounds of cleanup to remove non-production code, fix syntax errors, and ensure Pydantic V2 compatibility for data models.

**Last Completed Steps:**
- Refactored enum-like classes in `src/models.py` to use Python's `Enum` for Pydantic V2 compatibility.
- Thoroughly scanned and cleaned all Python modules (`src/connectors.py`, `src/data_processor.py`, `src/signal_engine.py`, etc.) to remove leftover test/example code, fix improper line continuations, and resolve syntax errors.

**Current State of `todo.md`:**
- Most development steps for Phase 1 (MVP) are marked as complete or in the final stages of cleanup/testing.
- The next major step after your review will be "Step 018: Validate end-to-end functionality on Testnet."

**Files Included in this Archive (`binance_bot_snapshot_20250512_1802.zip`):**
- The entire `/home/ubuntu/binance_futures_bot` project directory, containing all source code, configuration examples, tests, and documentation.
- `/home/ubuntu/todo.md` (current task checklist).
- This `status_update.md` file.

**Next Steps (Pending Your Review):**
1.  **User Review:** You review the provided codebase and status.
2.  **Testnet Validation:** Proceed with running the bot on the Binance Testnet to validate end-to-end functionality, including:
    - WebSocket connections and data reception.
    - Kline processing and indicator calculation.
    - Signal generation based on the V1 SMA crossover strategy.
    - Order placement, management, and position tracking (simulated if live testnet keys are not immediately available/configured by the user).
    - Logging and basic monitoring.
3.  **Bug Fixing:** Address any issues identified during Testnet validation.
4.  **Final Packaging:** Prepare the final functional application for delivery.

**Notes:**
- The `config/config.yaml` is currently set up with placeholder API keys for Testnet. You will need to replace `YOUR_TESTNET_API_KEY` and `YOUR_TESTNET_API_SECRET` with your actual Binance Testnet API keys to perform live trading tests on the Testnet.
- The bot is designed to be run using `python3.11 -m src.main` from the `/home/ubuntu/binance_futures_bot` directory after installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

We are now pausing development to await your review of the current project state. Please let us know if you have any questions or feedback before we proceed to the Testnet validation phase.
